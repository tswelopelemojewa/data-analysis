data science journey


For the past two years, i have been working as an educator in the department of basic eduaction, I have recently developed an interest in data science.
 To get strated with it, i decided to use marks of learners i have been teaching, 2021 and 2022.
 
 Learning concepts like pandas and matplotlib, i had to use data to practice and learners marks were the closest thing i could think of.
 
 This could be one useful tool for Assessment commitees as i am able to identify and group learners who passed and who did not, learners who failed certain subjects and also make top 10 learners and best learners in respective subjects effortlessly.  
 
 This is the beginning of my Data Science Journey.
